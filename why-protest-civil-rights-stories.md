Why Protest?
============
### A Collection of Civil Rights Stories 
<br>
#### Charles Mauldin, Civil Rights Leader

At age 16, Mauldin became a student leader in the voting rights movement; he was with John Lewis leading the marchers from Selma to Montgomery when they were attacked by law enforcement on Bloody Sunday in 1965. 

>“You have to take one step at a time, day by day. John Lewis once said, “Find ways to get in the way of what is wrong in life” - injustice, discrimination, racism, and now gun violence. Find ways to get in the way of what you see as wrong. And realize that you don’t have to be extraordinary to change the world… you just have to do ordinary things on a constant basis. Stand up each day.”

#### Linda Blackmon Lowery, Civil Rights Leader

Lowery was the youngest person at the famous Selma to Montgomery March for voting rights; she turned 15 on the second day of the march.
>“I often tell young people that if you see something you think is wrong and it bothers you, then with steady, loving confrontation, you can get others to see the wrong in whatever it is that you see. Someone will hear you and join you. There are other people who feel the way you’re feeling but they may not be able to express it the way you do. If I could follow a vow from 7 years old to 15 years old, I believe you can follow yours if you’re determined to do it.”
