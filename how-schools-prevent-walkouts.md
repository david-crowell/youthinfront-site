How Schools Prevent Walkouts
=================

Schools and districts want to distract you from organizing walkouts! [This is what Los Angeles Unified suggests](https://rems.ed.gov/docs/ll_vol3issue1.pdf): 
* Creating an educational component around issues of concern.
* Giving students an alternate forum for political expression.
* Persuading students it is not in their best interests to conduct a walkout.
* Scheduling an intervening event to distract or dissuade students from walking out.
