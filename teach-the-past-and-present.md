Teaching the past and present to explore civic engagement
=========================================================

Without endorsing a particular point of view or policy, teachers can focus on this moment of student activism as a case study in social change and civic participation writ large. The role of young people in pivotal moments like the US civil rights movement offers another entry point for thinking about the power and potential of youth voice. 

### Ask questions like: 
- How do we determine the most effective way to make a difference in our neighborhoods, our nations, and the world? 

- Which strategies are best for bringing about the changes we want to see? What levers of power are available? 

- Are there things young people can accomplish that adults cannot? 

- How do these stories help you reflect on the issues you care about? How do they suggest tools that you could use to make a difference?
