Students Have First Amendment Rights
=================

Although you don't necessarily have the right to disrupt school with a protest or a walkout, students do have some first amendment (free speech) rights.  According to the ACLU, these include:
* "wearing buttons, badges and other insignia (including armbands or message T-shirts)
* posting notices on school bulletin boards
* distributing petitions
* handing out other printed materials, such as leaflets
* writing in public school newspapers and yearbooks
* writing in “underground” (or unofficial) newspapers"

[This two-page sheet hooks you up with all the info on student speech rights](https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/immigrants/studentwalkouts20060503.pdf)
