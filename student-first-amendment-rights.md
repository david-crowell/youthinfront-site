Students Have First Amendment Rights
=================

Although you don't necessarily have the right to disrupt school with a protest or a walkout, students do have some First Amendment (free speech) rights.  According to the ACLU, these include:
* Wearing buttons, badges and other insignia (including armbands or message T-shirts)
* Posting notices on school bulletin boards
* Distributing petitions
* Handing out other printed materials, such as leaflets
* Writing in public school newspapers and yearbooks
* Writing in “underground” (or unofficial) newspapers
