High School Students' Field Guide for Activism:
=================
10 Week Plan for Legislative Action
---------------

Massachusetts high school students put together a "field guide" to help each other coordinate their actions to make legislative change (=change the law). They explain:

> "The 10-Week Legislative Action Guide offers a simple 10-week action plan to ensure that you and your team can make a real difference. If you can get 50 people to come in after school on the day of the walkout, and 20 people the week after that, and even 10 people in subsequent weeks, you have enough to make a change."
