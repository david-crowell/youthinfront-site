National School Boards Association on Teacher Speech Rights:
=================

"When assessing whether a public school can regulate an individual instance of employee speech, ask:
* Is the employee speaking as a private citizen or in her capacity as a school district employee, pursuant to her official duties? If she is speaking as an employee, there is more authority to regulate the speech.
* Is the employee speaking about a matter of public concern or a matter of personal interest? (Note: Not all employee speech about his/her employment is unprotected “employee speech.”) If she is speaking on a matter of personal interest, there is more authority to regulate the speech.
* Does the employee’s speech interfere with the district’s orderly operations? (i.e., Does the speech impair workplace discipline? Affect harmony among co workers? Result in loss of confidence/loyalty?) If so, there is more authority to regulate the speech." (p. 12.)
