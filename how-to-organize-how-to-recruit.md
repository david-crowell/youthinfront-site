### How to Recruit


>Create posters, use social media to spread the word, and talk to people to recruit them! 

>You can also use the comment hashtag on social media: **#ENOUGH**, **#Neveragain**, (letter writing campaign), **#WHATIF** (video posting to Twitter), and/or **#March for Our Lives** with the caption: *Join the National School Walkout to protest lawmakersâ€™ inaction on gun control.*
