### Know Your Rights

- In the USA it is legal to film police in public as long as you don’t interfere and comply if you’re told to back up.

- You can film things that are plainly visible from public spaces, but property owners set the rules in private spaces.

- Police can't search your phone without your consent or a warrant. They should never ask you to delete your videos.

### Be Safe
- Having a camera at a protest can make you a target for police. Stay out of arm's reach of the police. Wearing something that identifies you as a livestreamer or media can be helpful.

- Livestreaming can expose people’s identities, protesters’ tactics and other sensitive information far more easily than recorded video that you can edit. Evaluate the security risks before filming.

- Try anonymizing protesters by filming their feet or backs or capturing very wide shots.
