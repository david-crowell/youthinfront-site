How Teachers Can Safely Support Student Activists
=================

"We also understand that not all teachers enjoy the security or support that will allow them to walk out of school or participate in marches taking place across the country. If you fall into this category, there are other ways to engage this personal and widespread issue of gun violence in schools.

Sign petitions. Contact lawmakers about your concerns. Use the timing of the walkouts or marches to, instead, teach in, and engage and support your students' needs as they face an issue that very directly affects their safety and yours.

But above all, remember this: If you have already engendered in your students a desire, ability and confidence to express their thoughts and take action, you've already done the most important part.

Now, trust your work and support your students as they find their voice. Let them lead."
