How to respond to and support your students
===========================================

### For school leaders, productive responses to student protests:

- Teachers and school leaders can support students' right to protest without taking a stand on those views themselves. Defending students' right to voice their views can help foster civic participation.

- Align your response to your existing school/district mission.

- Encourage conversations about controversial issues throughout the year. Let students exercise their voices respectfully in school newspapers, podcasts, and YouTube channels, or in student council debates.

- At the same time, it's vital that schools protect students with dissenting views from harassment or bullying.
