What's the difference: Walkout, March, Protest?
=================

**Walkouts** and **marches** are both forms of **protest**: ways of making a public statement to voice disapproval and your opinion to influence policy and public opinion. Walkouts and protests both use collective action, where many people coordinate their protest at the same time and on the same day to make their voices heard and their messages louder.

You don't need to worry about fonts and stuff, just making sure things have a good *structure* (are the titles right?  are there links? are there lists? images?)
