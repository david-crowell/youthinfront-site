You get to meet with a decision-maker! How should you organize what you say?
=================

Successful presentations to decision-makers often follow this 7-part structure. Don't stress--you may need only a few sentences for each section. Chunk it out, then practice.

**Introduction:** Explain who you are

**Issue:** Introduce the issue immediately and state it clearly.

**Position and Ask:** Explain your position and your request

**Points:** Give clear and distinct reasons that support your position and request

**Counterpoints:** Respectfully acknowledge reasons against your position

**Conclusion:** Return to your positon and request, explain how the points you have made support it

**Appreciation:** Thank people for their time and attention
