Additional ways to respond to and support student protest
=========================================================

### Support Students’ Civil Rights . . .

> “School leaders can articulate that while they support students’ civil rights — including their right to engage in peaceful protest — students’ beliefs are their own. Schools can defend students’ rights to express themselves, without taking a stand on the content of that expression."  

### . . .  and Align Your Response with Your School/District Mission

> "The school or district’s mission statement can also be a helpful guide as leaders consider how to respond to protest incidents. What are your core values — the set of guiding principles that you’re always talking about? These can provide an essential touchstone as you try to navigate among stakeholders with deeply divided opinions.”
