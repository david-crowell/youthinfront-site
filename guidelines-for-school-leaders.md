Guidelines for School Leaders
=============================

**1. Ensure student input**

  * Meet with student leaders to assess needs and plans
  * Invite ideas for improving campus safety, culture, and security.
  
**2. Make them aware of the resources available for them**

  * Counseling and guidance support (if available)
  * Presence of increased staff, your district’s police department, or your district’s communications team for the safety of staff and students
  
**3. Help ensure that efforts are inclusive of ALL students, even those who may hold differing views or wish to not participate**

**4. With student input, provide space on campus for students to assemble peacefully, but also ask students not to move off of campus for their own safety and security**

**5. Stay in touch with Learning Community Superintendent, DISTRICT NAME Communications and DISTRICT NAME PD on any plans that may emerge.**
