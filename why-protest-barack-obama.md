Why Protest?: President Barack Obama
=================

>...You have to go through life with more than just passion for change; you need a strategy. I'll repeat that. I want you to have passion, but you have to have a strategy. Not just awareness, but action. Not just hashtags, but votes...Change isn’t something that happens every four years or eight years; change is not placing your faith in any particular politician and then just putting your feet up and saying, okay, go. Change is the effort of committed citizens who hitch their wagons to something bigger than themselves and fight for it every single day...”

-President Barack Obama, in a commencement address at Howard University, from [Facing History and Ourselves reading “Not Just Awareness, But Action"](https://www.facinghistory.org/holocaust-and-human-behavior/chapter-12/not-just-awareness-action).
