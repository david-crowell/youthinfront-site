Martin Luther King Jr.'s Six Principles of Nonviolence
=================

Nonviolent protest has been an essential part of social and political change in American history. Martin Luther King Jr. laid out six principles of nonviolence in his book [*Stride Towards Freedom*](https://www.amazon.com/Stride-Toward-Freedom-Montgomery-Story/dp/0062504908). 

* **PRINCIPLE ONE:** Nonviolence is a way of life for courageous people.
* **PRINCIPLE TWO:** Nonviolence seeks to win friendship and understanding.
* **PRINCIPLE THREE:** Nonviolence seeks to defeat injustice not people.
* **PRINCIPLE FOUR:** Nonviolence holds that suffering can educate and transform.
* **PRINCIPLE FIVE:** Nonviolence chooses love instead of hate.
* **PRINCIPLE SIX:** Nonviolence believes that the universe is on the side of justice.
