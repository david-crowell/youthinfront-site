How to write an op-ed
=====================

**A strong op-ed will include:**

**LEAD:** Draw the reader into caring about the issue with an interesting hook, such as a compelling story, powerful statistics/numbers, or a situation that most readers can immediately relate to

**PROBLEM:** Explain the issue and why it is a problem; include statistics and other relevant evidence and research

**SOLUTION:** Describe what you feel should be done about the issue

**COUNTER-POINT(S):** Predict possible arguments that opponents of your issue might raise and explain and provide reasoning for your disagreement

**CONCLUSION/CALL TO ACTION:** Reiterate how and why the reader should get involved
